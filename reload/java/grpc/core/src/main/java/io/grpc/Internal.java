/**
 * Annotates a program element (class, method, package etc) which is internal to gRPC, not part of
 * the public API, and should not be used by users of gRPC.
 *
 * <p>However, if you want to implement a custom {@link LoadBalancer}, an alternative transport, or
 * anything else that will be wired into gRPC library, you may use the internal parts.  Please
 * consult the gRPC team first, because internal APIs don't have the same API stability guarantee as
 * the public APIs do.
 *
 * <p>Note: This annotation is intended only for gRPC library code. Users should not attach this
 * annotation to their own code.
